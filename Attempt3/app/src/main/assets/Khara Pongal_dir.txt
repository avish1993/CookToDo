Soak half a cup of rice in water. 
Take half a cup of split moong dal and dry roast it on a very low flame until you can smell the roasted dal. It would take approximately 3 minutes. Don’t roast for long. 
Cook the dal and rice together in a pressure cooker with 4 cups of water for a good 15 minutes or 10-12 whistles.
    Coarsely grind pepper and cumin with the help of a mortar and pestle. Set aside.
    Heat some ghee and oil in a pan. I used 2 tablespoons of ghee and a tablespoon of oil. 
Add in the broken cashew nut, ginger, curry leaves and green chillies. Roast on a low flame. 
Once the nuts are roasted add in the pepper-cumin mixture. Roast briefly for 20 seconds.
    Add in the cooked rice-dal mixture and salt. Mix everything to combine. Saute briefly for a minute or two.
    Remove off heat.
